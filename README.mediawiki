Welcome to [[mw:User:✓|my]] Wikipedia Script Repository!

I've started coding long, long times ago with some very simple <code>monobook.js</code> experiments.
Soon, I got tired in the online editing, saving, cache-purging, testing cirlce and wanted a faster developing experience, so I started with [http://www.opera.com/docs/userjs/ Opera's userscript feature].

Today I'm running thousands of lines of local code (with less blank lines :-) in my browser, all to the greater aim of making my Wikipedia experience smoother.
And now I think that sharing this code might be a good idea, having you profiting of it. Of course, many things are feeble, outdated, and too localized, but you also will find some pearls.
Those pearls I'm gonna present also at [http://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=User:%E2%9C%93/scripts mediawiki.org], but before merging the greatest of them right into the MediaWiki software itself I feel I should show what I've come up with so far.
